# Weather Analysis for Agriculture

#### Team E Final Project by Kimberly Crawford, Gary Goodman, Trevor Lanouette and Lynda March

## Overview

### Purpose

#### Reasons Why Topic was Selected:

#### Questions We Hope to Answer with the Data:

- Python will be used to clean, prepare, and explore the data, as well as to complete initial analysis. 
- Python libraries, JavaScript libraries (such as Data-Driven Documents, or D3, and Plotly), and Tableau can be used to create visuals to help tell your data story.
- Database integration (Postgres, MongoDB, or SQLite) will be used to store cleaned data. 
- Machine learning will be implemented to enhance the topic. Tableau or JavaScript will be used to build a dashboard to present the results. 
- A presentation will be prepared and delivered that walks the class through the project, step by step.

## Branches

1) Presentation

2) Machine Learning Model

3) Database

4) Dashboard


## Deliverables

### First Segment: Sketch It Out

Decide on your overall project, select your question, and build a simple model. You'll connect the model to a fabricated database, using comma-separated values (CSV) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files, to prototype your idea.

### Second Segment: Build the Pieces

Train your model and build out the database you'll use for your final presentation.

### Third Segment: Plug It In

Connect your final database to your model, continue to train your model, and create your dashboard and presentation.

### Fourth Segment: Put It All Together

Put the final touches on your model, database, and dashboard. Lastly, create and deliver your final presentation to your class.
